# Java Swing Calculator

Simple calculator application developed with Swing and Java.

This project is a simple calculator application developed using Java 21 and Swing technologies, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations.
